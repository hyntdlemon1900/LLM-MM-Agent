        # =========================================================================
        # The cluster uses a standard 3-tier Fat-Tree topology organized into "Pods".
        # Understanding the bandwidth hierarchy and physical limits is CRITICAL.
        #
        # 1. Physical Hierarchy (Three Layers):
        #    - Edge Layer (ToR Switches): The bottom layer. This is the ONLY layer
        #      where endpoints connect. **BOTH Workers and Parameter Servers (PS)
        #      are physically attached to these switches.**
        #    - Aggregation Layer (Aggr Switches): Middle layer. Connects multiple
        #      ToR switches to form a "Pod".
        #    - Core Layer (Core Switches): Top layer. Interconnects different Pods.
        #
        # 2. Critical Bandwidth Bottleneck (2:1 Oversubscription):
        #    The network is designed with a specific "Oversubscription Ratio" to
        #    reflect realistic Data Center constraints:
        #    - Tapering Rule: At both Edge and Aggregation layers, the total bandwidth
        #      of Downlink ports (facing servers) is approximately TWICE the total
        #      bandwidth of Uplink ports (facing the core).
        #    - Consequence: This creates a **2:1 Bottleneck** for any traffic moving
        #      upwards. Traffic leaving a Pod (Cross-Pod) fights for half the
        #      bandwidth available to traffic staying inside a Pod (Intra-Pod).
        #
        # 3. Server Access Links (The "Last Mile"):
        #    - Worker Connection: Workers connect to ToR switches with standard
        #      baseline bandwidth.
        #    - PS Connection: Parameter Servers also connect to ToR switches, but
        #      are provisioned with **DOUBLE (2x) the bandwidth** of a standard
        #      worker link.
        #    - Bottleneck Warning: Despite the 2x capacity, the PS link is a strict
        #      "Many-to-One" bottleneck (Incast) because all workers of a job send
        #      data to this single link simultaneously.
